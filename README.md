Memory Game

Simple memory game.  Score a point for every card you select.  The game ends when you've selected the same card twice.

Notes:
This was an excercise in working with functional components.  The use of hooks is required.  

This app can still use some styling.  The history of selected cards is stored so a feature to display the history of chosen cards would take minimal effort.
